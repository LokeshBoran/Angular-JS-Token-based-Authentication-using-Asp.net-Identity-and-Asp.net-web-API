# Angular JS Token-based Authentication using Asp.net Identity and Asp.net web API
# ASP.NET Identity is designed to enable us to easily use a number of different storage providers for our ASP.NET applications. We can use # the supplied Identity providers that are included with the .NET Framework, or we can implement your own providers.

# In this tutorial, we will  build a Token-based Authentication using ASP.net identity ,ASP.net web API and AngularJS at front end

# With Token-based Authentication, the client application is not dependent on a specific authentication mechanism. The token is generated # # by the server and the Web API have some APIs to understand, validate the token and perform the authentication. This approach provides # # # Loose Coupling between client and the Web API.

# this toturial is not for beginners, to follow it, you must understand angularjs and asp.net and REST services
